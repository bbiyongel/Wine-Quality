(String color: red, white)
(Decimal)
fixed acidity		most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
volatile acidity		the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
citric acid			found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
residual sugar		the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
chlorides			the amount of salt in the wine
free sulfur dioxide		the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
total sulfur dioxide		amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
density			the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
pH			describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
sulphates			a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
alcohol			the percent alcohol content of the wine
quality			output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10)
